<p align="center">The Arctic Ice Studio Git Style Guide.</p>

---

To present [Git commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) in an organized, standardized, and easy-to-read manner, this official style guide describes how the content should be structured, organized, spelled and formatted in all Arctic Ice Studio projects.

There are only some strict rules but mostly guidelines since we are more interested in content than formatting and the review process may help contributors to conform to this guide later on.

## Introduction

Commit messages are important parts of communication between contributors and for the lifecycle of the project: its past and its future. It is the only place that captures not only what was changed, but why.

For open source project communities it is important to maintain good habits of communication in all forms. A well-crafted commit message can save a lot of time and overhead and helps to speed up development processes.
